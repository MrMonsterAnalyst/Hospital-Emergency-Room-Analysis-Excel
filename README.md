# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis-Excel

Tools: Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Advanced Charts, Slicers)

Domain: Healthcare Analytics | Operations & Patient Experience

Project Overview:
Developed a monthly Emergency Room operations dashboard to analyze patient volume, wait times, admission outcomes, departmental referrals, and patient satisfaction, with the objective of identifying bottlenecks, demand patterns, and service-quality risks in a high-pressure healthcare environment.

Key Contributions & Insights:

Analyzed 9,216 ER patient visits to assess overall demand load and operational capacity across monthly and yearly views.

Evaluated average patient wait time (35.26 minutes) and linked it to on-time vs delayed service distribution, identifying service efficiency gaps impacting patient experience.

Assessed patient satisfaction score (4.99) alongside wait-time trends to understand service quality trade-offs under high patient volume.

Performed admission outcome analysis, revealing a near 50/50 split between admitted and non-admitted patients, indicating high ER utilization even for non-critical cases.

Conducted demographic analysis by age and gender, identifying the 60–69 age group as the highest ER utilization segment, supporting targeted resource planning.

Analyzed department-level referrals, showing that General Practice and Orthopedics account for the majority of ER patient flow, highlighting opportunities for better triage and load redistribution.

Designed time-based (month, year) and demographic filters to enable hospital administrators to drill down into specific periods and patient segments without manual reporting.

Business / Operational Impact:

Supported recommendations for triage optimization, staff allocation during peak-load periods, and wait-time reduction strategies.

Highlighted the need for diverting non-critical cases away from ER to reduce congestion and improve care quality.

Provided a data-backed foundation for balancing patient experience vs operational efficiency.
